 # Project Description
During the COVID 19 crisis, the requirement of plasma became a high priority and the donor count has become low. Saving the donor information and helping the needy by notifying the current donors list, would be a helping hand. In regard to the problem faced, an application is to be built which would take the donor details, store them and inform them upon a request.

# Software Required
 - Python
 - Flask
 - Docker
 
 # Project Workflow
 - The user interacts with the application.
 - Registers by giving the details as a donor.
 - The database will have all the details and if a user posts a request then the concerned blood group donors will get notified about it.
